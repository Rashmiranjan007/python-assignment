TASK 1

2.Write a program which will find all such numbers which are divisible by 7 but are not a multiple of 5, between 2000 and 3200 (both included). The numbers obtained should be printed in a comma-separated sequence on a single line.

Code#

for i in range(2000,3200):
    if (i % 7 == 0) and (i % 5 !=0):
        print(i,end=',')
        
        
        
3.Write a Python program to accept the user's first and last name and then getting them printed in
the the reverse order with a space between first name and last name.

Code#


      first_name,last_name =input("enter First name and Lat name :" ).split(' ')
      print(last_name,first_name)


4.Write a Python program to find the volume of a sphere with diameter 12 cm.
Formula: V=4/3 * π * r 3 

Code#
    
      from math import pi
      r = int(input("enter the radius: "))
      v=4/3 * pi *r**3  
      print(v)
      
  TASK 2
  
  1. Write a program which accepts a sequence of comma-separated numbers from console and generate a list. 
  
  Code#
    n =int(input('enter the number : '))
    for i in range(n):
        print(i,end=',')
  2.Create the below pattern using nested for loop in Python. 
  
  Code #
  
    n=5
    for i in range(n):
        for j in range(i):
            print('*',end='')
        print('')
    for i in range(n,0,-1):
        for j in range(i):
            print('*',end='')
        print('')
        
        
3.Write a Python program to reverse a word after accepting the input from the user. 
 
Sample Output: 
 
Input word: AcadGild 

Code#
Word_rev= input('Enter word :' )
print(Word_rev[::-1])
 
Output: dilGdacA

Sample Output: 
 
WE, THE PEOPLE OF INDIA,   having solemnly resolved to constitute India into a SOVEREIGN, !  SOCIALIST, SECULAR, DEMOCRATIC REPUBLIC    and to secure to all its citizens 


Code#

print('WE, THE PEOPLE OF INDIA,\n      having solemnly resolved to constitute India into a SOVEREIGN, ! \n           SOCIALIST, SECULAR, DEMOCRATIC REPUBLIC \n            and to secure to all its citizens')
